# Overview

This is a project I created in December 2025 for my father's retirement from teaching. In my house, we have a tradition where, on the last few weeks of the school year, my father would lay out his ties on our stair banister and take one down each day to mark the ending of the semester. For his retirement, I decided to do the same - have one tie on the banister for each day that remained of his teaching career. To take a tie down, the user has to solve a KenKen puzzle, something we both love. After solving the puzzle, I decided to insert personal messages of motivation and meaning for him to read on select days.

This marks my first foray into app creation, Java Script, React, and Vite. I had the help of some AI software to learn the basics, and I hope to continue to develop more personalized projects like this.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
