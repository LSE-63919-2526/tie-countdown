I know you said you didn’t want a massive celebration, but I couldn’t let this semester go by for you without at least a small reminder everyday of what you have meant to everyone you have taught, taught with, talked to, led, and ministered to through your time teaching at East Tipp. I built this from scratch, just for you - I promise there’s nothing like it anywhere else on the internet. I love you, Dad. Call me when you get this! 💛"
